			<p>During lockdown I began working on a project with a friend. We are both big fans of independent video games. The project is an open world, pixel art role playing game set in feudal Korea. My friend is experienced in graphic design, so they drew up all the characters, animations and world design. I began learning programming during lockdown and have been writing up the code for the game.
			</p>
			
			<p>Game maker studio 2 uses its own programming language which blends JavaScript and C. I have been learning JavaScript through Udemy online, so it felt familiar and Iâ€™m getting more used to it every day.
			</p>
			
			<p>Using my limited knowledge and some help from YouTube tutorials, the game has been coming to life. I am still very much learning as I am going along, but I am dedicated to the process.
